    "The Pokémon franchise, introduced originally as a Nintendo video game (1996), is all about catching, training, and battling with Pokémon (a Japanese shortening of “Pocket Monster\"). Over the years, there have come to be over 800 fictional Pokémon species that range from animal-like to plant-like creatures, and even species based on inanimate objects (like *Klang* which looks like interlocking gears). \n",

    "There are eighteen different Types of Pokémon (such as Grass, Water, Fire, etc.) and each type has its own individual strengths and weaknesses. For instance, Grass is generally strong against Water, Water is usually strong against Fire, and Fire is generally strong against Grass (similar to the game “Rock, Paper, Scissors”). \n",

    "The goal of the game is to become the strongest Trainer by catching and training as many Pokémon as you can and battling them against your opponent’s Pokémon (hence, the slogan “Gotta catch ‘em all!”). When you catch a Pokémon, they shrink down into poké balls that can fit in your pocket."
